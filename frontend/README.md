# Furniture Recommender Frontend

React + Vite + Tailwind UI for the conversational furniture recommender.

## Setup

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

## Run the Dev Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

The app expects the FastAPI backend to be available at `http://localhost:8000/api`. You can override this by creating a `.env` file with `VITE_API_BASE_URL`.
